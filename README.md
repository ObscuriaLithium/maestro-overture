Maestro: Overture is a music resource pack built for the [Maestro](https://modrinth.com/mod/maestro-music) framework, adding handcrafted, thematic music to structures and key events across the world.

## Features

#### Extending Vanilla Atmosphere
Overture is designed to complement Minecraft's vanilla tone rather than replace it. The added music integrates seamlessly with existing tracks, enhancing exploration and events without overwhelming the original atmosphere.

#### Current Music Coverage
At the moment, custom music is implemented for **8 major structures** as well as a small set of **key environmental events**. This coverage represents the current scope of the system and will expand over time.
